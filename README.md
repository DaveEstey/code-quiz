# Decription
This project was used to better skills with creating and using elements in Javascript, as well as take in local storage input, as well as event listeners into the code. Made from scratch, This is to test skills on logic of timers and input manipulation. I learned that when making multiple elements that are independant but do the same thing, you only need one event listener for all instead of creating one for each. as well as it is a lot more difficult to change the functionality of a function instead of using a different method.
